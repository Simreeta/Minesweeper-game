# Minesweeper game. 
Minesweeper is a single-player puzzle video game. The objective of the game is to clear a rectangular board containing hidden "mines" or bombs without detonating any of them, with help from clues about the number of neighbouring mines in each field.
Bombs are denoted with ‘X’ and randomly placed it anywhere. The number of bombs is based on the level of difficulty.
Here we used DFS, but both DFS and BFS can be used
Initially the bombs are placed randomly and based on the number of bombs in the adjacent cells, the value of the particular cell is incremented.

Two Square matrices are to be maintained- one matrix updates the value every time and is displayed after any cell is chosen. Another matrix has the bomb and is checked with always, until the final go.
